Lab 4 Web Map
====

#### Map created by Lydia Nowak. 

*Project Outline*

This lab for Web Mapping was focused on the creation of an interactive choropleth map. This map was created using Leaflet base maps from a remote server. This map was created to show the Percentage of Population Without Access to a Healthy Diet. I chose to focus on the countries in Eastern Asia, so I created a code to focus on China, since that is the central area of the mapped data. I also edited the legend to show an orange to red gradient of the country percentages.

*Sources* 

This map was created using data from Leaflet as well as Our World In Data, which was downloaded as a .csv file. This .csv file was then put into the geojson.io website to edit the data further. There I created a new attribute for the countries within Eastern Asia to tell the percentage of the population that cannot afford a healthy diet. This data was then dowloaded and added to the Lab 4 folder on VisualStudio. The countries I included data for were:

* Mongolia
* South Korea
* Japan
* Bangladesh
* India
* China
* Indonesia
* Thailand
* Vietnam
* Myanmar
* Bhutan
* Pakistan
* Philippines
* Malaysia
* Nepal
* Laos

The GeoJSON was then downloaded from <a href="http://geojson.io/#map=1.24/-23.1/0">geojson.io</a> and uploaded to VisualStudio. This data was then connected to the webpage on the index tab and edits were made to create a legend to portray the percent data ranging from 0% - 100%.
